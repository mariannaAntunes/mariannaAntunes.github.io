              <p>and I'm 29 years old, Brazilian and married. I also love new challenges and adventures.</p>
              <p>That's why I'm now living in Calgary/CA as an international student. Here I have the opportunity to get to know different places, people and cultures and improve my career development.
                I'm also close to one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen: the Rocky Mountains!</p>
